## ⭑⚝ Before you interact (BYI) ๋࣭ ⭑⚝ 

- I struggle with interacting; im not the best on having conversations (im sorry).
  - If i really feel the encourage or just active to talk, i will interact first.
    - **ᡣ𐭩** If you do interact with me, i often use silly emotes rather than talking to interact back.
      - I sometimes get too comfy, I can be a bit quirky with my sense of humor or communication style at times. If anything I do makes you uncomfortable, **please** let me know and I'll do my best to ease up and **im so sorry**.
- I may not always express myself in the best way due to **English not being my native language**.
  - **ᡣ𐭩** **Please** let me know if I ever say or do anything that you find inappropriate or offensive. I'm always willing to learn and improve, and I appreciate your honesty in pointing out any missteps.
    - **ᡣ𐭩** **Please** do **INT** with me! **C+H** is fine; **i would be so happy!!!** ♡
     > - Whisper to interact (W2I) probably afk
